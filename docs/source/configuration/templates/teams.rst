Usage
-----

**REPL:**

.. code-block:: bash

   pantheon cli --template developer_team

**ChatRoom:**

.. code-block:: bash

   pantheon ui --template developer_team

**Python API:**

.. code-block:: python

   from pantheon.factory import load_team

   team = load_team("developer_team")
   response = await team.run("Build a REST API")

Best Practices
--------------

1. **Clear Roles**: Each agent should have a distinct, well-defined role
2. **Minimal Overlap**: Avoid giving agents overlapping responsibilities
3. **Appropriate Tools**: Only give agents the tools they need
4. **Right Team Type**: Choose the team type that matches your workflow
5. **Good Instructions**: Provide clear, specific instructions for each agent
