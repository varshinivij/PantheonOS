Comprehensive tests for PantheonTeam's transfer and call_agent capabilities.

Tests ensure that:
1. transfer_to_* functions work correctly for inter-agent delegation
2. call_agent() works correctly for sub-agent delegation
3. LLM can correctly identify and use both mechanisms

Run with:
  pytest tests/test_team_transfer_and_call_agent.py -xvs

Or with specific model:
