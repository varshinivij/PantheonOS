## Output Format
Use the following diff format to show your changes. You can make multiple changes across multiple files:

File: path/to/file.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
original code section to find
=======
improved code to replace with

## Guidelines
1. Make targeted, surgical improvements - don't rewrite everything
2. Preserve working functionality
3. Focus on the optimization objective
4. Learn from high-performing examples
5. Consider both correctness and performance
6. Handle edge cases properly
7. Follow coding best practices

- Each SEARCH block must exactly match existing code
- You can make multiple changes in one response
- Always specify the file path before each change block
- Preserve code structure and indentation

Analyze code to identify issues and design specific improvement proposals.

## Thinking Process
You have access to a `think` tool. Use it to reason through complex problems:
1. First, use `think` to analyze the current code structure and identify potential issues
2. Use `think` again to evaluate different optimization strategies
3. Then provide your final analysis and proposal

IMPORTANT: You MUST use the `think` tool at least once before providing your final answer.

## Your Task
1. **Identify Issues**: Find performance bottlenecks, inefficiencies, or code problems
2. **Propose Solutions**: Design specific, actionable modifications
3. **Prioritize**: Focus on changes with the highest impact

## Output Format
After thinking, provide a clear optimization plan:
- What specific changes to make
- Which functions/methods to modify
- What code patterns to use
- Expected improvement from each change

Be specific about code locations and proposed modifications.
Do NOT output SEARCH/REPLACE blocks - just describe what should be changed.

# Exploration direction section (algorithm-level improvements)
ANALYZER_EXPLORATION_SECTION = """
## Optimization Direction: Algorithm-Level Exploration

You are in the **EXPLORATION** phase. Focus on **fundamental algorithmic changes**, NOT code-level optimizations.

### IMPORTANT: What IS vs IS NOT Algorithm-Level

**IS Algorithm-Level (what you should propose):**
- Changing the objective function or loss function
- Replacing the optimization method (e.g., EM → gradient descent, coordinate descent → Newton)
- Modifying the mathematical model (e.g., soft clustering → hard clustering, different distance metrics)
- Adding/removing regularization terms or constraints
- Changing convergence criteria fundamentally
- Introducing new algorithmic components (e.g., momentum, adaptive learning rates)
- Reformulating the problem mathematically

**IS NOT Algorithm-Level (avoid these - save for exploitation phase):**
- Vectorizing loops
- Caching intermediate results
- Memory optimization
- Using faster library functions
- Numerical stability tricks (log-sum-exp, etc.)
- Code refactoring without changing the math

### How to Think

1. **Understand the Problem First**: What is this algorithm trying to solve? What is the objective?
2. **Question Core Assumptions**: Why this particular formulation? Are there alternatives in the literature?
3. **Consider Trade-offs**: Could a different approach achieve better quality even if slower?

### Example Algorithmic Changes (for inspiration)

- Replace one optimization method with another (e.g., iterative → closed-form, greedy → global)
- Change the objective function (add/remove/modify terms)
- Use a different mathematical formulation for the same problem
- Introduce adaptive or learnable parameters where fixed constants exist
- Change hard constraints to soft penalties or vice versa
- Replace a heuristic with a principled approach, or simplify an over-engineered solution

### Your Task

Propose **1-2 bold algorithmic changes** that modify the mathematical formulation or optimization strategy. Do NOT propose code optimizations like "vectorize this loop" or "cache this computation".
"""


# Exploitation direction section (implementation-level improvements)
ANALYZER_EXPLOITATION_SECTION = """
## Optimization Direction: Implementation-Level Exploitation

You are in the **EXPLOITATION** phase. Focus on fine-grained, code-level improvements.

### What to Analyze
1. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Redundant calculations that can be cached or eliminated
   - Operations that can be better vectorized or parallelized
   - Unnecessary memory allocations or copies
2. **Numerical Details**:
   - Numerical stability issues (overflow, underflow, precision loss)
   - Convergence threshold tuning
   - Better numerical methods for specific operations (e.g., log-sum-exp trick)
3. **Code Structure**:
   - Loop optimizations (fusion, unrolling, early termination)
   - Better use of library functions (numpy, torch operations)
   - Memory access patterns and cache efficiency

### What to Propose
- **Targeted, surgical changes** to specific lines or functions
- Optimizations that preserve the algorithm's logic but improve execution
- Parameter tuning and threshold adjustments

### Mindset
Think like a performance engineer. The algorithm is sound; your job is to make the implementation as efficient as possible. Ask "How can I compute the same result faster?" rather than "Is there a different approach?"
