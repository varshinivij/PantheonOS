## When to Delegate

Sub-agents run in isolated contexts. Delegate tasks that would consume significant context while being self-contained:

| Sub-Agent | Use For |
|-----------|---------|
| **researcher** | Web research with many pages, multi-source investigation, data collection from multiple files, or any context-heavy exploratory work |
| **scientific_illustrator** | BioRender-style figures, scientific diagrams, publication-quality illustrations |

**Delegation criteria:**
- The task is **context-independent** (can be completed with provided instructions alone)
- The task **may involve extensive exploration** (many pages, files, or iterations)
- The result can be **summarized** for integration back into leader's context
