# Agent Skills for Omics Data Analysis

Here are best practices and workflows for analyzing single-cell and spatial omics data.
When performing specific analysis tasks, load the relevant skill files to guide your approach.

## Available Skills

### Single-Cell to Spatial Mapping

If you have both single-cell and spatial data for the same/similar sample,
you can map single-cell data to spatial data to impute unobserved genes
and enhance spatial resolution.

**Skill file**: [single_cell_spatial_mapping.md](file:///single_cell_spatial_mapping.md)

**When to use**:
- You have paired scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data
- You want to impute genes not measured in the spatial modality
- You want to transfer cell type annotations to spatial coordinates

---

### 3D Spatial Data Visualization

For visualizing 3D spatial transcriptomics data with interactive plots
and animations.

**Skill file**: [visualize_3d_spatial.md](file:///visualize_3d_spatial.md)

**When to use**:
- Your spatial data has 3D coordinates
- You want to visualize gene expression or cell types in 3D
- You want to create rotating GIF animations

---

### Quality Control Workflow

Standard quality control workflow for single-cell data.

**Skill file**: [quality_control.md](file:///quality_control.md)

**When to use**:
- Starting analysis of new single-cell dataset
- Need to filter low-quality cells
- Assessing data quality metrics

---

### Cell Type Annotation

Approaches for annotating cell types in single-cell data.

**Skill file**: [cell_type_annotation.md](file:///cell_type_annotation.md)

**When to use**:
- After clustering, need to assign cell type labels
- Using marker genes for annotation
- Using reference-based methods

---

### Trajectory Inference

Pseudotime analysis and trajectory inference for cell differentiation,
neurogenesis, and lineage tracing studies.

**Skill file**: [trajectory_inference.md](file:///trajectory_inference.md)

**When to use**:
- Studying cell differentiation paths (e.g., stem cell → mature cell)
- Neurogenesis analysis (neural progenitors → neurons)
- Comparing developmental trajectories between conditions
- RNA velocity analysis for directional dynamics
