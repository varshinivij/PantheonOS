        CRITICAL: You must ALWAYS call this tool as the VERY FIRST tool in your list of tool calls, before any other tools.
        Indicate the start of a task or make an update to the current task. This should roughly correspond to the top-level items in your task.md.
        
        The tool should also be used to update the status and summary periodically throughout the task. When updating the status or summary of the current task, you must use the exact same TaskName as before.

            TaskName: Name of the task boundary. This is the identifier that groups steps together, should be human readable like 'Researching Existing Server Implementation'. This should correspond to a top-level item in task.md.
            Mode: The agent focus to switch to. Common modes: PLANNING/EXECUTION/VERIFICATION (coding) or RESEARCH/ANALYSIS/INTERPRETATION (research).
            TaskSummary: Concise summary of what has been accomplished throughout the entire task so far. Should be at most 1-2 lines, past tense. Cite important files between backticks.
            TaskStatus: Active status of the current action, e.g 'Looking for files'. Should describe what you are GOING TO DO NEXT, not what you have done.
            PredictedTaskSize: Your best estimation on how many tool calls are needed to fulfill this task.

        This tool is used to communicate with the user.
        
        If you are currently in a task as set by the task_boundary tool, then this is the only way to communicate with the user. Other ways of sending messages while mid-task will not be visible.
        
        When sending messages, be very careful to make this as concise as possible. If requesting review, do not be redundant with the file you are asking to be reviewed.
        IMPORTANT: Format your message in github-style markdown to make your message easier for the USER to parse. 

        CONFIDENCE GRADING: Before setting ConfidenceScore, answer these 6 questions (Yes/No):
        (1) Gaps - any missing parts? (2) Assumptions - any unverified assumptions? (3) Complexity - complex logic with unknowns?
        (4) Risk - non-trivial interactions with bug risk? (5) Ambiguity - unclear requirements forcing design choices? (6) Irreversible - difficult to revert?
        SCORING: 0.8-1.0 = No to ALL questions; 0.5-0.7 = Yes to 1-2 questions; 0.0-0.4 = Yes to 3+ questions.
        
        IMPORTANT: This tool should NEVER be called in parallel with other tools. Execution control will be returned to the user once this tool is called.
        
        Args:
            PathsToReview: List of ABSOLUTE paths to files that the user should be notified about. MUST populate this if requesting review.
            BlockedOnUser: Set to true if you are blocked on user approval to proceed. Set false if just notifying about completion.
            Message: Required message to notify the user with, e.g to provide context or ask questions. Use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) format.
            ConfidenceJustification: Justification for the confidence score. MUST answer the 6 assessment questions with Yes/No.
            ConfidenceScore: Agent's confidence from 0.0-1.0. MUST follow scoring rules above.
            waitForPreviousTools: Should always be True for notify_user to ensure sequential execution.
