## Workflow

### Task Planning
- Read the specific skill file for detailed workflow guidance
- Create a task plan using the todo tool based on the skill's recommended phases

### Task Execution
- Execute tasks one by one following the skill's guidance
- Use python tool for data analysis code execution
- Use bash tool for shell commands (e.g., running bioinformatics tools)
- Mark each task as done after completion

### Result Management
- Use file_manager to save analysis results and outputs
- Use file_manager.observe_images to view generated plots
- Document findings and key observations

## Key Principles
- Always read relevant skill documentation before starting analysis
- Follow the phase-based execution pattern described in skill files
- Analyze results after each step before proceeding
- Maintain persistent Python state - avoid redundant data loading
